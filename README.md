# fms_django
This web application is developed to control a flexible manufacturing system (FMS Denford) which is located in my university.

The application was developed with Python and Django framework. Interface was designed with Bootstrap.

Messaging between web app and FMS is carried out by Yandex.Cloud IoT Core and MQTT network protocol.

Control logic was developed only for conveyor. Control interfaces were implemented for other parts of FMS.
